## Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability

We recommend using the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/henryhchchc/mokapot/security/advisories/new) to confidentially report vulnerabilities. This ensures your report is handled securely and reaches the maintainers directly. Do **not** create a public GitHub issue. We will respond as quickly as possible and work with you to address the issue.

### Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the latest released version of MokaPot. Older versions may not receive security fixes.

### Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address reported vulnerabilities before any public disclosure. We are committed to resolving security issues promptly and will credit reporters in release notes if desired.

### Security Best Practices

- Always use the latest stable release of MokaPot.
- Review the [changelog](https://github.com/henryhchchc/mokapot/releases) for security-related updates.
- Avoid using pre-release or development versions in production environments.
